It is better to use the waiting-approach, which is the BanketNoWait module.
The Banket module uses the not-waiting approach (or active waiting/ busy waiting) which will use more CPU time since the
thread keeps checking the condition in a loop. Effectively this is a blocking pattern, and in general should be avoided
as a technique when a resource is expecting input or access to a lock.
When using the waiting approach, the thread goes to sleep until it is notified using the Java call `Thread.sleep(200);`
which saves CPU time. This allows the processor to be used to execute a different task instead of being wasted on useless activity.
